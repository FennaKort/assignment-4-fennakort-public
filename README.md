# Cellular Automaton Project
This project was built in fulfillment of a course deliverable for COMP 1701 at Mount Royal University. The assignment brief was to create a cellular automaton that follows the rules of [Conway's Game of Life](https://conwaylife.com/). We were given the view_grid visualization function and the docstring and parameters to use in our main function as starter code. 

This project uses Python and focuses on function design, file I/O and handling text, 2D lists, and implementing loops. Please see the [notes.md](notes.md) file for additional notes made during my working process.
